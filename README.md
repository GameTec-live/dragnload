A stupid little rust project to upload files
---
A stupid little rust project that opens up a webserver where another device can upload files to.

Designed to just get a file from one PC to another over the local network

No, its not encrypted, Yes, its probably the worst rust code that you have ever seen, Yes it contains more lines embedded HTML/CSS/JS than actual rust and No, i dont encourage you to use it, but it works, is a single standalone executable and starts up quick. A  C programm could probably do the same though and not take up 4000KB, so maybe just look for something better...
